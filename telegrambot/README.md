This example is an extension to my BcrypPasswordEncoder project where I have basically simulated the functionality of an user's sign up and its authentication. In this example I have tried to take it to the Bot programing level where I will be sending user's login or sign up activities to the Bot of Telegram API which might further send it to a group of people  joined in a particular group using group's chatId.
